TRUE TODO::
----------------------	
1. Should probably make JavaScript look more like the Java from ppt examples
		
2. Fix the mains (javascript code with multiple main event programs)
	
3. Save manipulated sound to a file (write);
???4. Use the mediaThingObject for combining audio buffers into a longer sound??? (music track???)

5. ADD LINK SHARING (hm...)

6. Add languages?

****SADLY: does not work in IE :(
	(IE doesn't support audio buffers as far as I know...
		is there any other object workaround besides implementing
		audio buffers myself?)


==========================================
Additional::(???Old)
------------------------------
0. Freeze/Unfreeze shouldn't let user drag new blocks
	-should be safer (don't attach values to blocks as they can be messed with by Blockly)

add freq blocks

add scale blocks?? (like scale will generate the freq/note of the scale)
