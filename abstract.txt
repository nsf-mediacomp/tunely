Media Computation in Visual Programming for Early Learners using Blockly

Introducing programming concepts to children early in their education can be beneficial because the type of problem solving that encompasses computational thinking is becoming increasingly dominant in our technology-driven society. A new breed of programming environments is being developed for students first learning to program. These environments use intuitive visual drag-and-drop blocks that can express a program, such as MIT's Scratch, Berkeley's SNAP!, or the open source Blockly. One such feature that is lacking from these environments is the ability to perform media computation: for example, image manipulation through pixel manipulation, or audio generation. The proposed research will investigate the design and implementation of a block language (using Blockly) that will allow media computation in an easy and intuitive to understand way, in order to allow K-8 students to grasp the concept and create their own expressive media.
