NOW:
---------------------------------------------------------------
(bugs/improvements??)
--------------------------------------------
1. save/export sounds based on their current state??? (in addition to original state?)
3. Large sounds break Tunely (what is the limit?? should have a failcheck)
B. when only piano, sinewave example changed original sound???
	-try running program, deleting a sound, then reseting
D. Add a checkbox that will disable/enable explore synth synching for better play

===============================================================
LATER:
---------------------------------------------------------------
3. should have error messages for incorrectly uploading sounds (or images as sounds)
1. why does selecting new sound not auto select the new sound in the block? (minor)
???5. Use the mediaThingObject for combining audio buffers into a longer sound??? (music track???)
6. example program should use the sine wave note generation to play an arpeggio???
