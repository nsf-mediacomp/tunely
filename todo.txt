NOW:
---------------------------------------------------------------	
0. Dynamically created sound problems:
	A.should flush newly emptied sounds by playing them once??? 
		(try sine wave example with empty sound and removing the play command at the top)	
	B. exporting/importing projects with dynamically created blank sounds doesn't currently work
		(need to create similar fix as for uploaded sounds)
	C. creating a new sound shouldn't white out mini canvas display
	
2. update landing page to be tunely...
	A. Make new tutorial video
	B. Make html tutorial/manual
3. should have error messages for incorrectly uploading sounds (or images as sounds)
D. Add a checkbox that will disable/enable explore synth synching for better play

===============================================================
LATER:
---------------------------------------------------------------
???5. Use the mediaThingObject for combining audio buffers into a longer sound??? (music track???)
6. example program should use the sine wave note generation to play an arpeggio???
